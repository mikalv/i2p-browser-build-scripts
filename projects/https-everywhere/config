  # HTTPS Everywhere is expected to be the same on all platforms. To avoid
  # building the same thing 4 times, using 4 different container images
  # (each one with a different suite or architecture), we set the container
  # to wheezy/amd64 for all platforms. This allows us to create only one
  # container image, and also build the extension only one time as the
  # filename does not contain the platform, and var/build_id should be
  # the same since there is now nothing platform specific in the build
  # inputs. This allows us to save a little time and disk space.
